							<h2>Good Design</h2>
							<span class="image main" style="width: 15%">

							</span>
							<p>
								For something that could be considered good design I wanted to look at elements from apps/websites that I use often and have never caused me discomfort.
								So when I randomly opened up my most used website (Google Drive) I noticed that everything that I wanted to do with the app itself could be easily acessible through the sidebar it presents (Illustrative picture above).
								Never when looking and using the application have I ever wanted to do something that was not present in the sidebar. Goodle Drive being above all else, a storage application for me,
								provides a very simple but intuitive way to organize your files and folders. Be it recent, which helps when working on a project and we exit the application. Shared with me, which has saved me
								hundreds of times and makes it simple to go and grab something you haven't touched in a while but someone went to you. And finally Starred, for documents that we want to more easily access all the time and can just "Star" them.
							</p>
							<p>
								Not only is the interface easy and simple to use but it's positioning, being tucked in the left corner of the screen, allows a user to touch it at a moment notice but doesn't get in the way of looking at your files.
								When thinking of bad aspects of this interface I pondered for a long time. Do I believe the font or icons are good enough. Is there a functionality that I would prefer to have. Is the positioning wrong or the sidebar too big/small.
								And to all of these questions my answer is always "I like it this way and wouldn't change it". And that's what I truly believe good design is, it has a purpose, fullfills a need and overall, there's not really a lot of change that could/should happen.
								A design that just easily integrates within our workflow and no matter how many times we open it, how long it has been since we checked, it stays working and constant.
							</p>

                            <h2>Bad Design</h2>
							<span class="image main" style="width: 100%">

							</span>
							<p>
								For my bad design I decided to look at cookie pop-ups. The picture above is just a representation of one that I quickly found.
								Cookies have become quintessential with web browsing. There will not be a site where we don't run into them and as such the way their pop-ups are designed will have a big
								effect on how we browse the internet.
								This might be what makes them more frustrating, as something that became part of our everyday lives, if they're designed in a way that makes them irritating it will worsen our time online.
								Looking at the example above there are two main points where I believe they're designed in a frustrating way. We'll look into them and then understand better why they're designed in such a way.
							</p>
							<p>
								Firstly, this particualr pop-up completely locked the screen in place.
								This means that as long as I didn't interact with it, I could not use the website for it's intended purpose. This made cookies, something that should not be a priority for my web browsing experience,
								something that I couldn't simply ignore. Making something secondary for the experience, the main focus if not dealt with, is in of itself, bad design. But then we move onto the second point.
							</p>
							<p>
								Cookies are widely regarded as something negative. They're used, for the most part, to collect personal information of users and then be sold for more targeted advertising.
								This means that most people would like to simply "not allow" them wherever they go. Well, this becomes a problem when most of the cookie pop-ups don't simply provide this options.
								If I as user, wanted to do my prefered task, I would have to click into the "More options" ("Mais opções" in the image) button, then deselect all cookies manually, and finally confirm my coices.
								For a lesser hassle I could just press the button "accept all" ("Concordo" in the image) but as stated before, I, as most users, do not want to have cookies on when I'm browsing the internet.
							</p>
							<p>
								This leads to the following question:"If cookies are secondary and most users don't want them, why not simply make it easy for them to be disabled?".
								This is where I believe they are not simply bad design by a fault, but bad design in nature. meaning they're made to be a hassle, to be annoying to deal with.
								Websites have an incentive to have cookies on them, as they would allow for the harvesting for users data and lead to monetary gain. This means that as a website owner
								I want my users to have cookies always on. So what can I do to make that into a reality? Make it so that the easiest option (the one that will get rid of the pop up
								in a simple click), enables all cookies, that way my users will have an incentive to turn them on.
							</p>

							<p>
								In a way cookie pop-ups are well designed. They are built for the purpose of having bigger monetary gain for the website by having them on.
								But when it comes to the user experience, they are some of the most frustrating designs out there to deal with and that's why I consider it bad design.
